# Learning C++

## First Program

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "abc";
    return 0;
};
```

## Variables

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

- int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
- double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
- char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
- string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
- bool - stores values with two states: true or false

## Constants

You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change:
Example
```c++
const int minutesPerHour = 60;
const float PI = 3.14;
```

## Tricks

```c++
int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
```

```c++
int x, y, z;
x = y = z = 50;
cout << x + y + z;
```
